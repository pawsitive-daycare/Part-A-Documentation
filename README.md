## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to help with being able to connect the business with potential clients and have them have a seamless and easier way to communicate information. Our main goal for this application is to ensure that all necessary data and information about the service is provided in one place so that clients can access whichever information they need to at ease. The use of the application is through the seamless booking and payment service which will be provided on the website to help clients book the services that the business provides through their own pace and without the need of phone call.
